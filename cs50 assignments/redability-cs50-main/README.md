# redability-cs50
a program that computes the Coleman-Liau index of a given text. The Coleman-Liau index is a readability test designed to determine the grade level needed to understand the text. The program should prompt the user for a string of text, count the number of letters, words, and sentences, and then calculate the index using the formula:
index = 0.0588 × L − 0.296 × S − 15.8
where L is the average number of letters per 100 words, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words. The program should then output the grade level, rounded to the nearest integer.
